# AskNelson

A mobile-first Progressive Web App for an Employee Assistance Programme (EAP):
a client-side content and wellness portal. No backend, no database, no auth —
everything runs in the browser and persists to `localStorage`.

## Stack

- Vite + React
- Tailwind CSS (custom components only — no UI library)
- PWA via `vite-plugin-pwa` (service worker + manifest, offline-capable)
- Routing via `react-router-dom`

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # http://localhost:5173
npm run build    # production build
npm run preview  # preview the production build
```

## Pages

| Tab        | Route        | What it does                                         |
| ---------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Explore    | `/explore`   | Browse articles/videos, filter by theme chips        |
| Journeys   | `/journeys`  | Pick & follow a 30-day programme, progress in storage |
| Assessments| `/assessments` · `/assessments/:id` | Self-check screeners: intro → one question at a time → scored result |
| Meditate   | `/meditate`  | Timer (5/10/15/20 min) with optional ambient sound    |
| AskNelson  | `/asknelson` | SOS button + booking links to Kaelo Lifestyle         |

On desktop (≥1024px) the bottom tab bar becomes a left sidebar and content
widens into multi-column grids; mobile keeps the bottom nav + single column.

## Data files

Both live in `src/data/`. The components read these exact shapes.

### `explore.json`

Themes wrap their own content; each theme becomes a filter chip and supplies the
accent colour for its cards.

```json
{
  "explore": {
    "themes": [
      {
        "id": "anxiety",
        "title": "Anxiety & Stress",
        "description": "Understand and manage anxiety in everyday life.",
        "color": "#7F77DD",
        "bg": "#EEEDFE",
        "icon": "ti-heart-rate-monitor",
        "content": [
          {
            "id": "ax-01",
            "type": "article",
            "title": "What is anxiety and why do we feel it?",
            "description": "A plain-language guide…",
            "source": "Mind UK",
            "url": "https://example.com/article",
            "read_time_mins": 8
          },
          {
            "id": "ax-02",
            "type": "video",
            "title": "How anxiety affects your body",
            "description": "A short animated explainer…",
            "source": "TED-Ed",
            "url": "https://example.com/video",
            "duration_mins": 5
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

- `type` is `"article"` or `"video"` (lowercase).
- Articles use `read_time_mins`; videos use `duration_mins`. The UI renders
  these as `"8 min read"` / `"5 min"`.

### `journeys.json`

```json
{
  "journeys": [
    {
      "id": "anxiety",
      "title": "Understanding Your Anxiety",
      "description": "A 30-day guided journey…",
      "duration_days": 30,
      "color": "#7F77DD",
      "icon": "ti-heart-rate-monitor",
      "days": [
        {
          "day": 1,
          "type": "read",
          "title": "What is anxiety, really?",
          "task": "Read this plain-language explainer…",
          "source_title": "What is anxiety? — Mind UK",
          "source_url": "https://example.com",
          "reflection": "After reading, write down one situation…"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

- `type` is `"read"`, `"watch"`, `"reflect"`, or `"practice"` (lowercase).
- `source_title` / `source_url` are optional per day (`null` when absent);
  `reflection` is an optional prompt shown on the current-day card.
- Progress is stored at `asknelson.journey.<id>` as
  `{ startDate, completedDays: [] }`, with the active journey id at
  `asknelson.activeJourney`.

### `assessments.json`

Each assessment is fully self-describing — content, scoring, bands, and CTAs all
live in JSON so they can be edited without touching code.

```json
{
  "assessments": [
    {
      "id": "anxiety",
      "title": "Anxiety Check",
      "subtitle": "A quick, validated screen for anxiety symptoms.",
      "description": "…",
      "color": "#7F77DD",
      "bg": "#EEEDFE",
      "icon": "ti-heart-rate-monitor",
      "time_mins": 2,
      "retake_after_days": 14,
      "disclaimer": "This is a self-check, not a diagnosis.",
      "instructions": "Over the last 2 weeks…",
      "response_scale": [{ "label": "Not at all", "value": 0 }],
      "questions": [{ "id": "q1", "text": "…" }],
      "scoring": { "type": "sum", "min": 0, "max": 21 },
      "results": [
        {
          "band": "Minimal anxiety",
          "min": 0,
          "max": 4,
          "headline": "…",
          "body": "…",
          "cta": { "type": "explore", "target": "mindfulness", "label": "…" }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Scoring rules (implemented in `src/lib/assessmentScoring.js`):

- **Score = sum of selected option values.** Options come from the assessment's
  `response_scale`, except where a question has its own `options` array (the
  Sleep assessment), which take precedence.
- **`"reverse": true`** on a question scores it as `scale_max - response` (using
  `scoring.scale_max`), so higher always means "more of the measured thing".
- **`"type": "sum_with_dimensions"`** (Burnout) also computes each dimension's
  subtotal; if a dimension reaches its `high_threshold`, the matching
  `dimension_flags` note is shown on the result — even when the overall band is
  lower.
- The final score is matched to the `results[]` band whose `min`/`max` range it
  falls in.
- **CTAs** route by `cta.type`: `journey` opens that journey by `target` id,
  `explore` opens that Explore theme by `target` id (`/explore?theme=…`),
  `asknelson` opens the AskNelson tab.

**Safety gate (critical).** If an assessment has a `safety` object (the Mood /
PHQ-9 check), and its `trigger_question` is answered above the `trigger_when`
threshold (e.g. `q9 > 0`), the result screen shows the `safety` headline/body/CTA
**first and instead of** the normal band — regardless of total score. This is a
hard, non-skippable gate.

History is stored at `asknelson.assessment.<id>` as
`{ lastScore, lastBand, lastDate, history: [{ date, score, band }] }`. **Only the
score, band, and date are persisted — never the raw answers.** `retake_after_days`
drives the "ready to retake" hint on each card. All result copy is screening
language; nothing states the user "has" a condition.

## Meditation audio

Add files to `src/assets/sounds/`: `rain.mp3`, `forest.mp3`, `ocean.mp3`,
`bowls.mp3`. They're picked up automatically. See that folder's README.

## Notifications

`src/services/NotificationService.js` is a scaffold. On first load (after 5s)
the app asks for notification permission and stores the choice in
`localStorage`. `scheduleNotification(title, body, delayMs)` currently uses a
local `setTimeout` fallback — the real scheduling is left as a `TODO` for a
future OneSignal integration.

## Icons

`public/icons/*.png` are solid-navy placeholders generated by
`scripts/gen-icons.mjs`. Replace them (and `public/favicon.svg`) with real brand
assets, then regenerate or overwrite as needed.

## Brand

Placeholder colours live in `tailwind.config.js`:

- Primary navy `#172B5C` (`brand`)
- Primary green `#4CB03F` (`brand-green`)

Replace with real hex values when brand assets arrive.
